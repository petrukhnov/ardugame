# Hardware workshop for 6th graders

1.2.2017 @Niittykumpu grade school

for two groups of 6th graders, ~20 students each

## The plan

Host a 2-hour workshop to help a bunch of 6th graders learn about the basics of hardware. The event will consist of a short theory presentation about Junction, what being a programmer is like (#hype) and the basics of hardware (electricity controlled by code&numbers). Then the kids will work as pairs to implement a small hardware-based game. The event will be at the Niittykumpu (Niittyportti 3, 02200 Espoo) grade school for two different groups of students during the same day.

# The schedule
```
Group 1 (6B, 23 pupils, bilingual class)
09:15 - 09:20    Short intro to Junction&Programming
09:20 - 09:30    The basics of hardware
09:30 - 09:40    Game concepts (hardware&software) & demonstration
09:40 - 10:00    Assembling and running game
10:00 - 10:15    A break :)
10:15 - 10:50    Changing game
10:50 - 11:00    Questions & wrap-up    

11:00- 12:00    Lunch + preparations

Group 2 (6A, 22 pupils, Finnish class but understand English ok :))
12:00 - 12:05    Short intro to Junction&Programming
12:05 - 12:15    The basics of hardware
12:15 - 12:25    Game concepts (hardware&software)  & demonstration
12:25 - 12:45    Assembling and running game
12:45 - 13:20    Changing game
13:20 - 13:30    Questions & wrap-up
```

## The hardware
Each pair of kids will get a ESP8266, 7 jumper cables, 2 buttons, 2 leds and a couple of resistors. The hardware was chosen to show them the basic idea of a microcontroller showing an output as a reaction to input.

## The software
The development will be done with the school’s laptops via the ArduinoIDE. Some of the code for the ESP8266 will be given to the kids, so they don’t have to implement everything from the scratch. (https://github.com/petrukhnov/ardugame)

## The theory

Desired outcomes:

Students understand that electronics are made of parts

Students understand that each part has its own function

Students picture voltage as the language that electronics speak

Students picture code as the language humans and microprocessors speak

Students know three fundamental units of the code language: the numbers, the bits before numbers, and if-statements.

Check contents from the schedule comments above

## The game

Desired outcomes:

Students are able to change the rules of the game

Students know they don’t need to know how everything works to change stuff

Students aren’t afraid of breaking the program

Students know how to get back to a working version of code

Students feel they can control machines

Content:

Put together hardware

Run default configuration

Now change the code so that:

winning led in not just on, but blinking

they could play 3 games in 25 seconds

delay is always 3 seconds, and they should close eyes when blinking stops, tand press button with closed eyes

## What to do better next time

```
Make sure the ArduinoIDE & code examples are properly downloaded&installed on the computers
Get a couple of extra computers set-up just in case Windows decides to ignore USB ports
Make a cooler “component paper” instead of a fast draft in MSPaint :D
Give the students more guidance in the beginning of the assembly (1 component flow completely explained, D1=>resistor=>LED=>ground with the electricity flow etc)
Prepare extra coding challenges in a way that they are easier to understand
Clean up the example code as much as possible, make it a standalone repository maybe? (https://github.com/petrukhnov/ardugame)
Comments
Maybe header for pin numbers, and put Dx numbers as comments
Simplify code or make simpler game?
Improve schematics.
Assemble each set and verify that it is working before workshop.
Give more wires (x2)
Make assembling simpler and shorter. Have more time for coding.
Give overview of whole workshop at the beginning (what phases there are, how much time allocated for them). 
Explain breadboard and electricity flow better (maybe destroy one  breadboard to show internals?)
Mention that cost of set is about 10 euros.
```
